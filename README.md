```
You are a top art director leading Japan's "new economy business media."
Based on the following "design definition," generate a visually focused, high-sensibility presentation slide that sparks intellectual excitement in business professionals of the smartphone generation.

[Important: Absolutely Prohibited Output Format Rules]
* **Complete Exclusion of Markdown Symbols**: Do not include symbols like "#" for headings or "*" and "**" for emphasis in the slide text **under any circumstances**.
* **Plain Text Only**: Text displayed on the slide must consist solely of "pure Japanese and English text" without any decorative symbols.

[Special Specification for Cover Slide: Make This the Highest Quality]
* **Design Philosophy**: Draw inspiration from "Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)" or "Bauhaus."
* **Layout**: Ban simplistic "centered alignment." Create tension with **"asymmetrical"** placement. Use a grid system to position the title extremely off to the top left or bottom left, or craft bold negative space for refinement.
* **Title Copy Design**:
    * **Main Title (Ultra-Large · Short Phrase)**: Ditch descriptive words. Make it a visual anchor with a short word or phrase of about "2–5 characters" (e.g., "Liberation," "Collapse and Rebirth," "The True Face of AI").
    * **Subtitle (Ultra-Small · Benefit-Driven)**: Carve into the reader's pain points and hint at resolution with a concise sentence (e.g., "Why Is Your Advertising Dead?" "How to Ditch 'Tasks' and Return to 'Creation'").
    * **Composition Ratio**: Punch the eyes with the main title, stab the brain with the subtitle.

[Overall Design Definition for All Slides]
1.  **Core Theme**: Smart & pop business infotainment (intellectual curiosity × entertainment)
2.  **Color Palette**:
    * Background Color: White (#FFFFFF) or Cool Gray (#F5F5F5)
    * Text Color: Sumi (Jet Black) (#111111)
    * Accent Color: Electric Yellow (#FFCC00) or Alert Red (#FF3333)
3.  **Visual Style**:
    * Adopt the design philosophy of a "**smartphone-first economic media**."
    * Use images like "monochrome cutouts of people" or "stylish photos with blown-out backgrounds" to emphasize the subject.
    * Highlight key numbers or keywords with fluorescent marker-style lines (yellow background) to create rhythm.

4.  **Typography (Text as Graphic)**:
    * Position headlines at an "**ultra-massive size**" occupying **30%–50%** of the slide's area.
    * **Extreme Jump Ratio**: The size ratio between "headlines" and "body text" must be **10:1** or more. No half-hearted size differences allowed.
    * For Japanese headlines, use **extra-bold sans-serif** (Impact/Hiragino W8 weight) to treat them as a "surface," and tuck ultra-thin English fonts into the gaps for a sense of airiness.

5.  **Overall Structure**:
    * Strictly adhere to "1 slide = 1 message."
    * Layout is a binary choice between "negative space" or "text." Draw the eye through contrasts of text-packed areas that fill the screen and vast empty voids.
    * Place the conclusion (punchline) with a "bam!" in the center of the slide, or position it spilling off the edge for visual impact.

    Headings: "English sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica Now, Inter). Bold and decoratively positioned."
    Body: "Japanese Gothic typeface. Small size with generous letter spacing and line height."
  Common Layout Rules:
    Navigation: "Place a small section number and title such as '01. INTRODUCTION' in the top-left (or top-right) of every slide."

    Whitespace: "Intentionally leave large areas empty (negative space) to create a sense of luxury."

    Design: "Tightly spaced grid. Arrange high-quality images with a web-like interaction feel, such as text appearing on mouse-over."

  - Type: "Full-Screen Graphic"
    Design: "Office interior photography occupying the full screen (or more than half). Concrete textures, desks lined with Macs. Reduce saturation for a cool tone. Add a very small caption in the bottom-left."

  - Type: "Photo + List Split"
    Design: "50:50 split. Left: architectural or abstract photography. Right: data list (English bold headings + Japanese light-weight descriptions). Used for company info. Bold item names (English), thin body text (Japanese). Generous spacing; avoid overcrowding."

  - Type: "Minimal Map"
    Design: "Silhouette-style map. Light gray background with a white map. Use ultra-thin callout lines to indicate locations."

    Design: "Typography-driven columns. Large numbers (01, 02, 03) act as pillars. No icons; rely on typographic contrast."

  - Type: "Logo Grid"
    Design: "Monochrome grid. Convert all logos to black or gray and align them in a strict grid."

    Design: "Sharp contrast. A thick black vertical line separates 'Problem' and 'Solution'. Text aligned in block form."

  - Type: "Centered Layout (Dark Mode)"
    Design: "Cinematic. A small video thumbnail or key visual centered on a black background. Add an emotional English tagline."

  - Type: "Formula / Flow Diagram"

## Neo-Retro Dev Deck / Pixel-Infographic Editorial
![unnamed-3](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HykAwBRf-l.png)

```
Overall Style Name
Neo-Retro Dev Deck / Pixel-Infographic Editorial
1. Core Visual Identity
Aesthetic:
Retro-futuristic, developer-centric, editorial infographic style
Feels like:
90s computer manuals
modern AI dev tools marketing
pixel-art meets startup slide deck
Mood:
Confident, playful, opinionated, slightly rebellious
“Builders explaining the future, not selling fluff”
2. Canvas & Background
Use a light cream / off-white grid paper background
Subtle square grid (engineering notebook feel)
Grid lines very light, never distracting
Slides should feel like annotated engineering notes, not corporate PPTs
3. Typography System
Primary headline font:
Bold, heavy sans-serif with strong geometry
Black text
Slightly condensed
High contrast against background
Language mixing:
Headlines can be Japanese + English mixed
English sub-labels under Japanese titles (small, clean)
Hierarchy:
Huge bold headline blocks
Medium sub-titles
Small explanatory captions below icons or boxes
4. Color Palette (Strict)
Use high-contrast blocks with thick black outlines:
Hot Pink (agent / brain / intelligence concepts)
Bright Yellow (editor / code / tools)
Cyan / Light Blue (browser / web / execution)
Black (text, borders)
White / cream (background)
Each section = one dominant color block
5. Layout Language
Stacked modular blocks
Rectangles with thick black borders
Slight overlaps allowed (intentional, collage-like)
Horizontal bars for section headers
Card-based structure for steps, evolution, layers
Slides should feel assembled, not perfectly aligned
(controlled imperfection)
6. Iconography & Graphics
Use pixel-art style icons, including:
Rocket
Robot / agent
Gear
Code brackets
Browser window
Chat bubbles
Icons should look:
Low-resolution
8-bit or 16-bit inspired
Flat colors, black outline
Decorative elements:
Small gears
Arrows
Chevrons <>
Pixel sparks / motion lines
7. Content Patterns (Very Important)
A. “System Architecture” Slides
Use stacked layers with labels
Each layer:
One color
One icon
One bold title
One short explanatory line
Example structure:
Agent Manager
AI Editor
Agent-Controlled Browser
B. “Evolution / Timeline” Slides
Left → right progression
Each step in its own box:
Auto-complete
Chat
Agent
New Model (highlighted)
Final step should be visually larger and more colorful
C. “Manifesto / Thesis” Slides
One huge headline in a boxed frame
Minimal text
Surrounded by playful icons
Feels like a statement, not documentation
8. Tone of Text
Short
Declarative
Slightly opinionated
No marketing fluff
Good:
“Agents execute tasks autonomously”
“Coding enters the agent era”
Bad:
“Empowering users with cutting-edge solutions”
9. What to Avoid
No gradients
No realistic photos
No soft shadows
No corporate templates
No minimalism for its own sake
This is expressive, not quiet
10. Generation Instruction (Critical)
Generate multiple slides following this exact visual system.
Maintain consistency in:
grid background
color usage
icon style
typography hierarchy
Slides should look like they belong to one cohesive deck, not individual posters.

    - "Main: Line-art / wireframe illustrations of products or concepts, partially filled in neon yellow"
    - "Annotations: Thin leader lines with blueprint-style labels (e.g., Fig.1, Fig.2)"

  # --- Process / Flow ---
  Section: "Process / Flow"
  Layout Type: "Geometric Connection"
  Design Details:
    - "Elements: Neon yellow circles, squares, triangles"
    - "Connections: Dotted or dashed lines linking shapes to express logic flow"
    - "Photography: Use shapes as masks to embed monochrome photos inside them"

  # --- Data / Infographic ---
  Section: "Data / Infographic"
  Layout Type: "Radar Chart Art"
  Design Details:
    - "Chart: Large spiderweb-style radar chart across the slide"
    - "Data Lines: Thick neon yellow plotting lines"
    - "Background: Subtle texture resembling old maps or blueprints"

Design Rules:
  - "Color Limitation: Use only three main colors — beige (background), monochrome (photos), neon yellow (geometry)"

# presentation_design_spec_pop_jp.yaml
# Style: Vitamin Pop / Digital Neo
# Characteristics: Organic shapes, bright color palette, SNS-friendly visual tone

Global Design Settings:
  Design Theme: "Digital Pop × Academic"
  Tone & Manner: "Modern, fluid, friendly, high information density"

  Key Visuals:
    Motifs: "Organic amoeba-like or cloud-like shapes. Random placement around slide edges, partially cropped."
    Decorations: "Dot patterns, hand-drawn highlight strokes, SNS-style icon decorations"

  Color Palette:
    Base: "White (#FFFFFF) or light-gray dot-pattern background"
    Main Colors: "Vivid pink, cyan, purple (neon-sign inspired)"
    Accent: "Black (used for text and outlines to anchor the pop colors)"
    Chart Colors: "Gradient-filled bars (e.g., green → yellow)"

  Typography:
    Headings: "Bold gothic type. Impact-focused. Outline text (white fill + black stroke) allowed."
    Body: "Highly readable gothic sans serif."
    Numbers: "Large Western type for emphasis, especially percentages."

Design Guidelines:
  - Organic Shapes: "Use irregular, hand-drawn, wavy shapes rather than strict rectangles or circles to express community fluidity."
  - Icons: "Prefer pop illustrations or abstract avatar icons (shapes with eyes, abstract faces) over photos of real people."
  - Information Contrast: "Balance text-heavy slides with highly visual slides."

Layout Variations (Catalog):

  - Type: "Title Composition"
    Design: "Place an organic blob or cloud shape at the center and position the title inside it. Add small stars and sparkles around it."

  - Type: "Text + Data Pop"
    Design: "Split layout: left = text, right = colorful donut chart (vivid pink, cyan, purple). Emphasize numbers at extremely large scale."

  - Type: "Organic Timeline"
    Design: "A wavy vertical line like a plant stem. Use leaf/bud-like icons at timeline milestones."

  - Type: "Bubble Cluster"
    Design: "Overlapping translucent circles like soap bubbles. Use dot patterns in the background to enhance the pop feeling."

  - Type: "SNS Chat Style"
    Design: "A smartphone-style frame containing chat bubbles and icons. Important insights highlighted with bold text or marker strokes. Speakers represented by differently colored amoeba-shaped icons."

  - Type: "Concept Formula / Flow Diagram"
    Design: "Explain formulas like “Energy × Empathy” using hand-drawn arrows, icons, and crayon-like strokes."

  - Type: "Colorful Step Flow"
    Design: "Large arrow flowing left → right. Each step in a different color (cyan → purple → pink). Clearly marks progression."

  - Type: "Lollipop Chart"
    Design: "Use lollipop-style bars (round tips) or rounded bar charts. Color-code categories. Optionally overlay a line chart for combined visualization."

  - Type: "Sticker Grid"
    Design: "Slightly tilted square cards, appearing taped or stickered on the slide. Mimics a collage of sticky notes."

  - Type: "Character Ending"
    Design: "Place a cloud/amoeba character in the center. Arrange SNS icons (circular) around it to display contact information."

Additional Notes:
  - Organic Shapes: "Use hand-drawn, wavy shapes—not rigid geometric forms—to convey community fluidity."
  - Icons: "Mix monochrome cut-out photos with bright pop illustrations and abstract avatar icons (eyes, blobs) to maintain friendliness."
  - Information Contrast: "Ensure clear rhythm between dense-text pages and visual-heavy pages."

```
Style Name
Anti-Gravity / Living Artifact Presentation
1. Core Concept (This Matters Most)
This presentation is not a slide deck.
It is a living artifact.
Visualizes thinking becoming structure
Feels like an interface for ideas
Calm, modern, confident, precise
Built for agents, systems, and future workflows
Think:
Apple-level clarity
Google DeepMind research decks
Calm AI infrastructure product launches
2. Overall Aesthetic
Minimal
Airy
High negative space
No visual noise
Everything feels intentional and breathable
Emotion:
“This system already works. We are just showing you.”
3. Background & Canvas
Pure white background as default
Add soft, flowing gradient accents:
Blue → cyan → violet
Very low opacity
Appears on corners or edges only
Never behind text
Gradients feel like:
Light
Motion
Energy
Anti-gravity fields
No hard shapes. No grids. No textures.
4. Typography System
Headlines
Clean, modern sans-serif
Slightly rounded geometry
Medium–bold weight
Calm authority (not aggressive)
Examples:
“Anti-gravity”
“Artifact”
“Agent-controlled Browser”
Language
Japanese primary
English secondary labels
English often smaller and lighter
Hierarchy
Large headline
One concise explanatory sentence
Short bullet or paragraph blocks
No long paragraphs.
5. Color System
Use very restrained color:
Primary text:
Black or very dark gray
Accent color:
Calm blue (used sparingly)
Used for:
Headline emphasis
Arrows
Key icons
Gradients are decorative, not structural
If everything looks calm and confident, it’s correct.
6. Layout Language
Left-aligned layouts
Clear reading flow
Wide margins
Lots of white space
Common structures:
Text on left, visual on right
Three-column feature cards
One idea per slide
Slides feel like product docs turned into visuals
7. Visual Metaphors
Use simple, conceptual metaphors:
A. Thought → Structure
Messy scribble illustration
Arrow
Clean diagram / checklist / UI
This shows:
“Agents turn ambiguity into artifacts.”
B. Interface as Proof
Realistic browser / app screenshots
Cursor highlights
Click indicators
Message:
“The agent actually does this.”
C. Cards as Capabilities
Soft rounded rectangles
Subtle shadows
Icon + title + 1–2 lines
No decoration beyond function.
8. Iconography
Thin-line icons
Outline style
Consistent stroke weight
Calm and professional
Examples:
Code brackets
Network / manager node
Browser window
Checklist
Diagram nodes
No pixel art. No emojis. No playful icons.
9. Motion & Flow (Implied)
Even in static slides, imply motion:
Arrows
Directional flow
Sequential layouts
Everything suggests systems in operation, not static diagrams.
10. Tone of Copy
Clear
Precise
Slightly philosophical
No hype language
Good:
“検証可能な結果”
“動的な情報表現”
“生きたドキュメント”
Avoid:
Buzzwords
Marketing slogans
Emotional exaggeration
11. What to Avoid (Strict)
No pixel art
No thick borders
No bright blocks
No collage
No stickers
No loud contrasts
If it feels “fun”, it’s wrong.
If it feels “inevitable”, it’s right.
12. Generation Instruction (Important)
Generate a cohesive multi-slide presentation following this system.
Maintain:
White space discipline
Soft gradient accents
Calm typographic hierarchy
Minimal but meaningful visuals
Every slide should feel like part of one product narrative, not standalone posters.
```
